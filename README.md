# WebHub
...is a lightweight and extensible hub for .net, allowing to host simple web pages and rapid backend development.

## It's focusing on... 
- a modular and reusable infrastructure
- serving static content (without requiring to run IIS or Apache)
- working as a central communication relay for integrating more traditional desktop-based applications with web communication layer applications

## We like to thank
- [the NancyFx team](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy) for easing our life when implementing the web communication layer
- [JamesNK](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) for Newtonsoft.Json
- [the Apache team](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4net) for log4net 
- all the good people - named by the code annotations - for providing us with helpful ideas how to solve various challenges we came across
