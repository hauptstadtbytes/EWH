# ['e:va]
...is an extensible .net-based web server, for implementing dynamic content delivery, (RESTful) web communication layers as well as static content delivery

...is the next evolution of the [WebHub project](https://github.com/idx-innovations/WebHub), started during the time at one of my former companies, resulting in

- a streamlined API and infrastructure, based on the [BYTES.NET](https://github.com/hauptstadtbytes/bytes.net) library
- improved logging 
- feature improvements and continuous maintenance

# I am sorry...
... there is no fully-featured documentation available right now. It will (hopefully) become part of one of the next releases. Until now, please feel free to contact me directly.

**Please note: ** You have to run Visual Studio with administrative rights, setting BYTES.EWH.CLI as startup project to make it work.

# I would like to thank
